To generate new rust project that has all the related github version control and test stuff

run the command:
cargo generate --git https://github.com/rust-github/template.git
(cargo-generate needs to be installed first: cargo install cargo-generate --locked)

Cargo generate will ask for the new project name and description.



To upload the new project to github

you need to sign into github on a browser and create a new repository for the project,
then change into the project directory and run the following commands:
git add -A
git commit -m 'Your reason for this commit'
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/projectname.git
git push -v -u origin main



IF there is a problem:

Did you for get to create the repository in github?
OR
Did you forget to create an ssh key with sshkeygen?
AND/OR
Did you forget to add the keys .pub file into your github account?
(Browse to settings -> keys -> new key,  in github.com)
